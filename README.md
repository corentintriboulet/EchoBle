# EchoBle
Group project sponsored by Groupama at Centrale Lyon 

Amid the agricultural crisis, many cereal farmers engage in forward selling, meaning they sell their crops prior to harvesting. This requires them to predict the harvest quantity months in advance. Overestimation leads to buying additional grain later. The EchoBl√© project seeks to develop a drone add-on for pre-harvest wheat yield estimation, offline and non-destructively.
